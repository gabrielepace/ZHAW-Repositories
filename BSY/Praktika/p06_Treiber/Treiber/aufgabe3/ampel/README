If you have Java installed use ampel.jar

    The program ampel.jar simulates a traffic light connected
    to the lp1 parallel port of a PC.

    The three colors are controled by the three lower bits of
    the data port (on when set to '1'):

	    b0 -> red 
	    b1 -> yellow
	    b2 -> green

	    b7 is set to '1' to make it work (emulates real
	    hardware).

    There is a key, which controls bit b6 of the status port:
    when key is pressed, b6 = '1' otherwise b6 = '0'.


If you have not Java installed

    a) use ampelSim.c ... just simple pseudo graphics

       the key is activated by pressing "ENTER"

    b) install Java !!!! but !!!!
       make sure you have enough disk space: the shell command
       "df -h /" should show alt least 500MB
